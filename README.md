# An example demo app created with Electron and MySQL 

This example demo is accompanying this tutorial on Techiediaries 

[5+ Ways to Persist Data in Node.js/Electron Apps](https://www.techiediaries.com/electron-data-persistence/)

Make sure to read the tutorial to see the pros and cons related to using MySQL+ plain SQL to persist 
data in Electron apps and also the other alternatives that you can use instead of this approach if you are looking 
for other options.

**Clone and run for a quick way to see Electron in action.**

This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.
